Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:
General

    What is Fabric
    How to deploy code to a server easily
    What is a tgz archive
    How to execute Fabric command locally
    How to execute Fabric command remotely
    How to transfer files with Fabric
    How to manage Nginx configuration
    What is the difference between root and alias in a Nginx configuration

Requirements
Python Scripts

    Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
    All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.4.0)
    All your files should end with a new line
    The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
    A README.md file at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
    Your code should use the PEP 8 style (version 1.7.*)
    Your Fabric file must work with Fabric 3 version 1.14.post1 (installation instruction below)
    All your files must be executable
    The length of your files will be tested using wc
    All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)')
    A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)
